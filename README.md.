📘 Task: Python List Operations
🧾 Objectives
Practice basic list operations in Python.

Understand how to modify, extend, and sort lists.

Learn how to search for elements in a list.

🛠️ Instructions
Create an empty list called my_list.

Append the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.

Insert the value 15 at the second position (index 1).

Extend the list with [50, 60, 70].

Remove the last element from the list.

Sort the list in ascending order.

Find and print the index of the value 30 in the final list.

✅ Expected Output

Index of 30: 4
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
💡 Notes
Use list.append() to add elements.

Use list.insert(index, value) to insert at a specific position.

Use list.extend() to combine two lists.

Use list.pop() to remove the last element.

Use list.sort() to sort the list.

Use list.index(value) to find the position of an element.

💻 Example Usage

$ python list_task.py
Index of 30: 4
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
